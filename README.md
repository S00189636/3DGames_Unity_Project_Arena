Year 2 Games Development end of the year project 

This includes 2 scenes the first scene is the level.

One player against one boss.

The boss will spawn meteors or a (mini bot) to try and defeat you and protect their motherland from you.

When you win it will take you to the second scene showing a great view and the credits.
